[[Session 2021.07.11 The Funeral of Holmgren Grenwold r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
Unicorn says she could maybe bring Holmgren back, but we need to sacrifice something -- not a thing necessarily, but how she had us agree not to lie for a month to bring Jadzia back -- some sort of inherently good personal sacrifice.

[[Session 2021.07.11 The Funeral of Holmgren Grenwold r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
## Saving Holmgren

Lachlan tries to offer to surrender his personal quest for vengeance to kill the person who killed his master.

-”A life for a life is a trade. But, I have already given you a life, but you have already taken.”

“I will accept your proposal, with an addition. You must do as you say, but you must also dedicate yourself to instilling this same value as him *points to [[HolmgrenR]]* within your lifetime.”

LACHLAN GOTTA BECOME HOLMGREN’S SPIRIT GUIDE -- stop his quest for revenge against the spirit guardian.

  

Lachlan agrees and Holmgren immediately wakes back up.

[[Session 2021.06.27 Wolfpack Mammoth Attack -- Electric Boogaloo r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
MIDWAY THROUGH THE FIGHT:

Briza decides to open the Antimagic Orb thing -- Urithana and the shadow monsters are caught in the blast -- Urithana transforms into her true form -- A UNICORN

[[Session 2021.05.23 Exploring the Feywild r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
They lead us to their fortress

Urithana is their leader/guide, speaks lots of language, taught them Elvish, going to help them

  

The goblins don’t exactly seem trustworthy, but they say they hate the queen so that’s good enough for me for now

  

Urithana is an elf, seems to be really nice and good, makes them feel like they want to be good, they describe her how a goblin would describe an elf

Wants dragon

Can’t lie for a month

Can’t observe the ritual

She knows some stuff about feywild, ask more about Thera

Things demand sacrifice

[[Session 2021.05.23 Exploring the Feywild r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
They say they live with some Elf named Urithana, inspires them to be good, teaches them different languages

[[Session 2021.05.23 Exploring the Feywild r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
Urithana is a drow with flowing bright red hair, ornate silken robes, long red nails
        
-   Seems to float around
- Seems much older and more mystical than she appears

[[Session 2021.05.23 Exploring the Feywild r]] -> [[UrithanaR]] | 2022-01-18
We discuss various things about who we are and where we’re from with Urithana
    
-   She basically asks us about our goals and intentions -- we say it kinda comes down to three things:
        -   Save Jadzia
        -   Save Thera
        -   Get the artifacts
            
    -   She asks us if we get Jadzia what we’ll do
        
        -   Get Thera and continue artifact quest
            
    -   We ask if helping Melvakar is good, will it help people
        
        -   She says it will help some people, probably not others
            
        -   Won’t really give a straight answer on if Melvakar and what we’re doing is good and right or not
            
    -   Says she can probably tell me a lot more about Thera and the Godvale and what I need to do to save her
        
    -   Says she’s very familiar with my people, has met lots, wouldn’t really say when/how recently, and that she knows what they did with Elysia and coming to the Feywild
        
        -   COME UP WITH MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
            
    -   Says she can bring back Jadzia, but we need to sacrifice something in return, not like diamonds and stuff, but typical fey trickery
        
        -   Someone suggests Aurene, she asks if I’d give her up, big talking ensues but I am immediately defensive and say absolutely not ,the others are like why not, Vola is on my side
            
        -   I go into a talk about how she’s a sentient creature, I am raising her but will not just trade her, it’s up to Aurene to choose her own path
            
        -   Urithana agrees with me, seems like was some sort of test of where I stand
            
    -   She says she can do a ritual, but there are stipulations
        
        -   We cannot try to observe or spy on the ritual in any way
            
        -   We cannot lie intentionally for 1 month -- YIKES
            
    -   We go off to do the ritual, putting the body from the bag on a bed -- Holmgren asks for time alone with her and spends a lot of time in private chat doing stuff discussing stuff
        
        -   sus
            
-   We end the session with Lachlan revealing he lied, and never tried casting Banishment again to return us to our home plane
