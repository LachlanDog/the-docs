# Holmgren

Old Religion God: Eldath

Dream plane vision: Between when kicked out of army and when he started questing with us.

With Mentor, training, did odds and ends around villages...Holmgren looks untroubled. Red barn.

Quiet village, helping other, Holmgren seems happy, comes from a small town. Doing good for people? Without Vengeance. Comfortable in non-descript setting.

Dwarves. (Maybe because of in dwarven part of continent)

Holmgrens in monastery sort of at this point, religious man took him in. Good Samariton group.

After Military before beating left for dead.

Sense of Community. Feeling purposeful, lightness to him. Peaceful.

His mentor: Older, could tell taller when younger. Dark Mediterreanian skin, bronzy. Wrinkled, looks in been out in sun. Black/Gray short curly hair.

Dark arm hair. Full beard. Sitting. Straw hat, normal clothes. Just average dude. Seems wise, lights up a room sort of thing. [[Ezechiel Sansonae]]

==Holmgren, horses, summoning steed, taking care of horses.==

[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[HolmgrenR]] | 2022-01-17:

After military, before the scattering when they were attacked, killed, scattered to the wind

“Another time when I didn’t know a lot about the way things were, I wish it had stayed that way.”

**Mentor Dude:** Older guy, ‘normal seeming dude’, not wearing ragged clothing, but very simple, like any guy on the street. No religious either. Functional and very wearable clothes.

-   Comes across as very wise, like you go away from him having learned a lesson
    
-   **Holmgren Mentor Name:** **Ezechiel Sansonae**
    
-   **Holmgren Monastery Religion:** **Eldath**

Holmgren doesn’t know what god he worships -- Lachlan reveals it’s [[Umberlee]] (The Bitch Queen), an evil sea goddess -- destructive and vengeful to both those who love and hate her.

Holmgren trips out in his room in [Sun & Cidre](Sun%20&%20Cidre). Has a drug vision of Zanzibar, she brought him a head in a bag -- the decayed head of Laddy Mook, his headmistress from the orphanage.

While we’re in the lobby a torrent of water comes from upstairs -- like a pipe burst or bath broke. Chaos and panic.
