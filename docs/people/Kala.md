Kala is a general in Elf city [Nymthalas](../places/Nymthalas.md) (?) . 

Was in Briza's Ice dragon bones place with us.

Kala survived the item monster, that's how dumb Launy got his bow!

Elusivness of a person in charge. Not like hiding, but someone who is used to dealing with careful information? Not not being helpful, just wants to know what we know or whatever.

```
Says she doesnt know about Vorgrim? Maybe I misunderstood what Meg said? Check Matteos notes
