Roe and [Aisha](Aisha.md) are interested but don’t tell us much.

Briza gets a journal she can write in to keep and touch with them.

We each get a badge, as well as an extra for Vanuth

I give Bort my Weird Metal Spike in Glass Flask as a birthday present… I will miss it.

  

Aisha: warforged

Roe laughed at Vanuth, said she’s a narc who wants to be popular so that’s why she wants badge to speakeasy (can’t get one cause she’s a narc), I forget why but for some reason agreed to give us some.
