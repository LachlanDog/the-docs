[Session 2020.07.12 Holmgren the Devil Worshipper r](TheWik-main/sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.07.12%20Holmgren%20the%20Devil%20Worshipper%20r.md) -> [Miss_S (review)](Miss_S%20(review).md) | 2022-01-19
Foyer of [Miss_S (review)](Miss_S%20(review).md)

Penny is still there making her tea and stuff

-   Nemiza asks to speak with Mrs. S, he asks where’s Briza
    
-   I tell him Briza’s dead, he’s distraught
    
-   Nemiza insinuates she’s ok, ‘she’s closer than you think’.
    
-   Penny gets very upset that I briefly said Briza was dead but brings us up to see Mrs. S
    
-   We try to get Mrs. S up to speed on what we know, explain Briza was assassinated because we investigated the Veil and then went to Daveed for protection and she’s like WTF
    
-   Then Holmgren reveals to us all that he delivered the letter and she gets terrified and furious because that’s the catalyst that kills everyone, kicks us all out except Briza
    
-   She also admits that Ox Bellows is bad but won’t say much, says she’s working with him to protect someone she loves
    
-   She has a private conversation with Briza, worries she’s gonna get fired, basically admits that Ox Bellows is a human trafficker does kidnapping and stuff to accomplish his ends
    
-   THERE ARE NO GOOD GUYS

Halfling comes up to Briza mourning Ms. S, is also very upset (named [[Penny Silvereyes]]?) Guard asks if anything can be done, there must be something that can be done. “Surely he has a store…?” don’t know what that means

[Session 2020.06.07 The Truth about Aloy & Meteors r](TheWik-main/sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.06.07%20The%20Truth%20about%20Aloy%20&%20Meteors%20r.md) -> [Miss_S (review)](Miss_S%20(review).md) | 2022-01-19
We get back to Fools Blade Tavern, Ms. S is waiting for us, she’s sad (not really disappointed in us, just sad) that we didn’t move on the quest and kill the guy or whatever she needed done (i’ll never get a handle on this) -- says the trial is today, it probably won’t go her way and we can’t get in cause its a closed trial, but she asks us to come by for a recess at 2 as moral support and sets up a cute moment with Briza, has a present with her -- she definitely gonna die. Veil gonna stage a jailbreak?

-   The Veil: Some sort of cult in Ko’Themar that Eida wants us to look into, they do all kinds of awful things but she wants us to look into them.
    
-   Grayson Orthak: Bad guy in prison who the veil wants to break out -- she wants us to stop their attempt before it happens
