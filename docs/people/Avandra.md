A woman, skirting around and hiding behind different places in this darkness

Goldish skin, glimmers slightly

Long blond hair, slightly grey

Magnificent sword in hand

Old man, armour matches design of her sword -- skeletal wings [[../Insights/Lyregren]]

Finally, a vision of some dragon -- A VOID DRAGON
