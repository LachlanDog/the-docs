[[Session 2021.11.14 The Dream Realm r]] -> [[VarenzaiR]] | 2022-01-17
**Varenzai Vision**

Scene from the Faelar academy ~60 years ago

Elyra, Daesyk, & Varenzai are around a table, working on Kudzu. Varenzai has Kudzu on table, Daesky is reading in a book (of enchantments, magic). Elyra is quietly watching with her ae at her side.

  

Kys & Taern are at another table drinking and arm wrestling, make some comment about hurrying it up to get to the Grotto before dusk, and Varenzai makes a comment back.

Coming out of the shadows, Elyra leans in, squeezes his shoulders, and gives him a kiss on the cheek before disappearing back into the shadows going further into the dark foliage.

I go ahead, stealth ok but don’t see much, so I try to get closer and closer. Eventually I accidentally come right up on him, and get charmed -- in this case my **Sylvan heritage** is a big disadvantage, I seem especially susceptible to him.

[Session 2020.08.09 The End of Secrets r](../sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.08.09%20The%20End%20of%20Secrets%20r.md) -> [Varenzai](TheWik-main/people/Varenzai.md) | 2022-01-19
Tells party about being from Alaren/Faelar, left because of the resistance there, basically that it got more extremist, less about preserving nature vs. dominating other races to protect it. He fought against this with friends in a sort of underground resistance, not really open rebellion, but more like two groups against each other in the background, violence and disappearances became increasingly common etc. He left when it became too dangerous to stay, some of his friends had already left and others left after. Very close friend was trying to leave but he doesn’t know if she was successful. [Elyra](Elyra.md)
