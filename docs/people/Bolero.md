4. Theory:
     Biaro was in Greyson’s place seemingly falsely accused. This relates back to Tora/Daveed/Jerome/Biaro high-school quest for the artifacts, Daveed set Biaro up because he was hot on the trail and was trying to eliminate them.

**IMPORTANT CORRECTION:** I completely misunderstood the connection with Bolero vs. Greyson -- Bolero was just there coincidentally, HE WAS NOT Greyson like I thought, he was just also there -- so like all my other plans still coulda worked or whatever.

As we get to courthouse, prisoner wagon comes through crowd, Blue dragonborn inside -- Tora breaks out, recognizes him, runs out and has the following conversation in Dwarvish:

She calls him: Bolero

**He calls her: Jad’zeeya = Tora**

“I was trying to get up the fucking mountain” -- B

“I’m not like Jerome, I’m not some fucking messiah, I don’t care about the means to this end, I care about the end.” -- B

“I got it, I have the conch, it’s in my room” -- B

At some point they switched to Draconic but I still understood.

Confront Tora about this after, she’s very upset and runs off for a bit but then come back -- we speak in Sylvan, not to hide from party but just passerbys

She knows this guy, somehow related to her and Jerome -- says he shouldn’t be in there and do not assassinate him (that’s why I asked in Sylvan)

I try to reassure her that we’re her friends and want to help her with and through this but we don’t know tf is going on -- I guess that it’s something about they had some club or were all friends in High School, learned about the artifacts and grouped together to find them, either for power or something (and so maybe she’s not fully honest about all of their intentions with them) -- she says this isn’t too far off from the truth (not the not being honest part, just the friends trying to find artifacts) and her and Varenzai share their first kind of nice moment
