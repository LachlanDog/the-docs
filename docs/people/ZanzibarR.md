[[Session 2020.10.05 Holmgren’s Sister r]] -> [[ZanzibarR]] | 2022-01-18
[[ZanzibarR]] = HOLMGREN’S SISTER -- EDIT LATER 07.06.2020 : SHE’s PROBABLY EVIL

-   Also Asimar
    
-   About same age, slightly younger, but looks much younger and very youthful -- was lost in [[Astral plane]] where she didn’t age
    
-   Has been looking for Holmgren her whole life with her parents
    
-   Came to take Holmgren to claim his ‘birthright’ -- that quest and other stuff isn’t as important -- this is annoying Tora

[[Session 2020.08.16 The Closed Day r]] -> [[ZanzibarR]] | 2022-01-18
Thrall translates the Ghyf letter for us. It says:

“Grenwold. You’ve said, time and time again, you knew who had this exalted staff, and where they’ve gone. Her patience grows very thin. You wander through these planes like a wildling. Your gift was not given without strings, and they grow taut in her grasp. She... is timeless. You...are timeless. For now. The shadow will follow the boy. Bring him to the divide, or we will. And not without leaving your fate to the voidstones, which will be your only companions. Dictated but not read, Vlaakith CLVII”

Briza looks through the papers she found at the room. Appears to be crazy notes in various languages written by Zanzibar. One seems to be some weird language spoken by the ‘Ghyf’. There are a few maps and a list of names:

-   Lati Grook -- This one is crossed out -- Cruel Headmistress from Holmgren’s orphanage, Asher found her dead.
    
-   Asher Drake
    
-   Orion ‘Dawnrunner’ Montgomery

[Session 2020.07.02 Stabby stab room r](../sessions/notes_matteo_brianedit/Session%202020.07.02%20Stabby%20stab%20room%20r.md) -> [Zanzibar](TheWik-main/people/Zanzibar.md) | 2022-01-19
She summons four fiends, we fight, almost TPK. She’s clearly not going after Holmgren, needs him for something.
