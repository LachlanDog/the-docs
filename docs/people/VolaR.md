[[Session 2021.01.17 Where’s Krampus r]] -> [[VolaR]] | 2022-01-18
In the meantime, Jadzia tries to connect Vola with her parents

  

Vola has a conversation with Billy the Rabbit, a local Arctic Hare, using her [[Laparine helmet]]. She gets some info about the nearby Frost Giants, and asks for some rope.

  

Jadzia’s watch comes and she casts the spell on Vola. Vola goes to some dreamscape described like 11 going into her trance, and manages to communicate with her mother.

  

Vola describes parts of our adventure to her mom, hears that the war has brought hard times for them, but a good challenge for her father, tells her about hammer and needing a new one, asks about her old friend, ‘Bren’? Mom, **Olive**, says she has heard stories about her, that she went to an apprenticeship in Sime Tolic, and is now in Kim Fal’Dhour, working under Nathalas Snowbeard.

They continue having an adorable touching conversation, Vola says she misses them, Olive says ‘I say this because I love you, but I don’t think this place misses you. You were never meant to stay here whittling your time away, that makes your dad and I happy, but you were meant to go do great things.’

Vola wakes up in the middle of the night, surrounded by darkness but feeling calm and focused.

She realises she’s in something that’s as close as to what she understands to be ‘Nirvana’ She gets an intense focus on the Ticking of his Clockwork Heart.

Had a nice home and upbringing but wanted to see the world. Trained as a blacksmith from as long as she could hold tools, good at it, but good fighter too. Always loved animals. Had a close friend, could have been something more, but they left for some reason (just moving as people do, not a big force pushing them out), so she said after that there were less reasons for her to stay, she wanted to travel and adventure before settling down.

Vola Friend: **Brene Gorel**
