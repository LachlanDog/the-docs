~~METAGAMING: ONLY~~ holmgren went so we don’t know, but someone (Ly’Ara?) gives him a letter, tells him to deliver it 10 blocks up street and then Company Zero is done with him. We don’t know this.

Young woman blue robes and book, old man, little girl in cloak with basket and flowers (girl Ly’Ara told Holmgren to give letters to?) go up the courthouse, girl goes up to Ms. S, gives her a red letter with something red inside

Briza and I notice a whistling and little black specks in the sky -- meteors descend and destroy the courthouse presumably killing everyone inside -- session ends here
