Jadzia/Jerome/Bolero were at a monastery with some others, notably assistant Arch-Mage Balthazar (he’s that guy from the Jungle who made us the portal here to the Arctic). One day a horrifying event happened, and the archmage was destroyed in twisted eyes and ichor. Apparently this was the work of Dullalan/Melvakar, a very powerful archfey of the Shadowfey. He was unhappy because his magical trinkets (the all-powerful artifacts) were missing, the monastery people had to return them to appease them or he’d wreak havoc on the world, starting wars and stuff.

“We were all together at the monastery, we were there for a long time, balthazar appeared to us and we have to fix it, we have to return the artifacts to where they belong”

IT’S HAPPENING SHE SAID MELVAKAR! (Sylvan for Dul’Lahan, archfey dude).

“Most higher beings don’t comprehend that men make cities. They simply don’t comprehend that there’s a layer of reality where monkeys and pigs write poetry.” -- This made Lachlan realise that his patron is Dul’Lahan (Melvakar) some seemingly very evil ArchFey.Somehow this made them realise they need to collect the artifacts and give them back to Melvakar to stop bad things happening in the world.
