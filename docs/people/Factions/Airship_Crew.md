[[Session 2020.08.16 The Closed Day r]] -> [[Airship_Crew]] | 2022-01-18
They say they also want to leave, but are going to wait 2-3 days -- they told the city they’re going to stop trading with them, so don’t want to piss them off further by sneaking out

[[Session 2020.08.30 All Aboard r]] -> [[Airship_Crew]] | 2022-01-18
## The Airship:

The Stormlight

Dragon Class Aravel Ship

Lots of filigree, ornate metal, dragon imagery as well as other mythology

Lightly to medium armoured -- much more obviously for speed than war

A few heavy cannons on board

Briza finds out that officially the crew are here to help advise on the potential creation of a new Skyport in Ko’Themar, but Nemo implies there’s more to that.

Lachlan’s lady owner human is named Mz Willow, Gryphon, the black long haired tabaxi from the air ship also knows her, gave her the gem that is in Lachlan’s collar -- that’s why she didn’t mug Lachlan.

THEY THOUGHT LACHLAN STOLE THE COLLAR FROM HER THAT’S WHY THEY FOLLOWED AND ATTACKED HIM, THEY DIDN’T REALIZE SHE GAVE IT TO HIM, THANKS FOR THE INFO VOLA

Nemo is very bright and bubbly, Caius is stoic and sort of apathetic to what’s going on but they’re all together
